## Reflection

#### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
By limiting work on progress 'WIP' and enable engage new important tasks.

#### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
Make a kanban board , choose specific needed columns , limit cards for each column and pritorize tasks.


## Tasks:-
I do not have access to Focus Bear Kanban Board so I can not do the first two tasks

#### One way I can use to improve task tracking is by choose the approiate columns needed.
