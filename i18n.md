### Implementing Internationalization with i18next #20

##### What challenges did you face while setting up i18next?
Searching for a good source to understand how it works as I found official docs overwhelming.

##### Why is it important to use a library like i18next instead of manually handling translations?
i18next enables easy scaling and async fetching translations files , which improve performance ,Also i18next has many plugins like i18next-http-backend.

##### How would you handle dynamic content (e.g., user-generated text) in a multilingual app?
Maybe using a Machine Translation API like Google Cloud Translation.

#### Task :-
Here it is links to the config file and a component displays a translated messaged :-

- [config.js](./react-project/src/i18next/config.js)

- [i18nTask](./react-project/src/components/i18nTask.jsx)
