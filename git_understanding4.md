# Branching & Team Collaboration #52

## Reflection

#### Why is pushing directly to main problematic?

- Breaks the main branch
- Does not enable code review
- Poor collboration

#### How do branches help with reviewing code?

Branches enable to make a specific branch for a feature or a bug that is totally isolated from the main branch
and when finished I can send a pull request for the isolated branch to ask teammates to review it.

#### What happens if two people edit the same file on different branches?

- Non-Overlapping edits
  when trying to merge no conflict happens.
- Overlapping edits
  A conflict arises when the last one tries to merge his edits
