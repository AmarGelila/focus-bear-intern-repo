## Reflections 
#### How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
Daily stand-ups and weekly planing helps team memebers stay synced with each other,
and each member gets help with any blockers.

#### Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
As a frontend developer I think daily stand-ups is the most important 
as I need to know the latest from backend developers and UX & UI Designers as soon as possible.


## Taks 
#### Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.
Plan for a non-work meetings.
