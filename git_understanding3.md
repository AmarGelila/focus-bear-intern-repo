## staging vs committing Issue #53 Reflection

#### What is the difference between staging and committing?

Staging is the step before committing , contains the files will be commited
Committing is a save point in the project , It records a snapshot of the current status of the project , and you can return to it in the future.

#### Why does Git separate these two steps?

- To create logical and atomic commits
- Review change before commit

#### When would you want to stage changes without committing?

when I have multiple unrelated changes
